Gatekeeper One
Difficulty 5/10

Make it past the gatekeeper and register as an entrant to pass this level.

Things that might help:
Remember what you've learned from the Telephone and Token levels.
You can learn more about the special function gasleft(), in Solidity's documentation (see here and here).

I think first thing is to make sure that I call this enter() function from a contract.
and also need to use call function to specify gas.

when I did uint16(tx.origin) meaning my wallet address's uint16, it gave me 5285.

so..I think the key should give me the same number when uint64ed and uint32ed.

anyway, it needs to have 5285

so it should definitely have 14 A5 in the beginning of the key.

clue1

0x14a5b8f7DF340D89F3f7609dedCcE79a416E946c
uint16 => 0x14a5

0x00001415 is (uint32(uint64(_gateKey))
so basically, it means. last digits are 1415

clue2

(uint32(uint64(_gateKey)) != uint64(_gateKey)

for example if
0x14a5b8f7DF340D89F3f7609dedCcE79a416E946c


left hand side of equation is
0x0000000000000000000000000000000000001415

40 jari.

right hand side is
0x0000000000000000000000000000000000001415

bytes8(64 bits) is uint64

there is something on the first part of bytes8 _key.

clue3

fuck it. I will just draw it on paper.

uint64 has 6 digits   2**6
uint16 has 4 digits   2**4
uint32 has 5 digits   2**5

so, the answer should be sth like

0xa014a5
