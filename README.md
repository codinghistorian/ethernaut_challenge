Working as a Solidity smart contract developer, I realized deeper understanding of Solidity security is essential. Therefore, I decided to start solving ethernaut challenges and archive my thoughts and solutions. Challenge starts on 1st of March 2022. Once the challenge finishes, I will move on to either Capture the Ether or Damn Vulnerable Defi.

Later maybe I should just add a screenshot of the game with levels completed.
