MagicNumber
Difficulty 6/10

To solve this level, you only need to provide the Ethernaut with a Solver, a contract that responds to whatIsTheMeaningOfLife() with the right number.

Easy right? Well... there's a catch.

The solver's code needs to be really tiny. Really reaaaaaallly tiny. Like freakin' really really itty-bitty tiny: 10 opcodes at most.

Hint: Perhaps its time to leave the comfort of the Solidity compiler momentarily, and build this one by hand O_o. That's right: Raw EVM bytecode.

Good luck!

So I can just put any number for the function to work..?

Maybe I should learn how to deploy a RAW evm code.

MAybe I will just try it in JS vm.
