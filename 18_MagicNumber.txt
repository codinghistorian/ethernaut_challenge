MagicNumber
Difficulty 6/10

To solve this level, you only need to provide the Ethernaut with a Solver, a contract that responds to whatIsTheMeaningOfLife() with the right number.

Easy right? Well... there's a catch.

The solver's code needs to be really tiny. Really reaaaaaallly tiny. Like freakin' really really itty-bitty tiny: 10 opcodes at most.

Hint: Perhaps its time to leave the comfort of the Solidity compiler momentarily, and build this one by hand O_o. That's right: Raw EVM bytecode.

Good luck!

So I can just put any number for the function to work..?

Maybe I should learn how to deploy a RAW evm code.

MAybe I will just try it in JS vm.

Maybe I should just use this bytecode deployer?

or maybe I should just try to write opcodes myself.

so
0)should be able to copy calldata
1)need to check function selector whatIsTheMeaningOfLife()
2)Need to somehow match the number inside calldata to a predefined number.

I think this shouldbe enough.

I gotta check how to deal with calldata
and also how to compare.
