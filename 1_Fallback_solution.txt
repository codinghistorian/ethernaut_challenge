Fallback
Difficulty 1/10

Look carefully at the contract's code below.

You will beat this level if

you claim ownership of the contract
you reduce its balance to 0


Things that might help

How to send ether outside of the ABI

Fallback methods


First thing I gotta do is to make sure that I get the ownership of the contract.
To get the ownership of the contract, I need to call receive() function.
Receive function is triggered when sending transactions without any data.
but in the require of receive() function, I need to have more than 0 value in
contributions mapping. So I need to first sendTransaction using contribute() function.
Since I will be using sendTransaction() method of web3.js, I need to first send ethers
to the smart contract when calling contribute() and the function's information needs to be inside the options as ABI bytes string.

So I will try.
