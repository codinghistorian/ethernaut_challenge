This one is about whether the hackers know about overflow/underflow.

Token
Difficulty 3/10

The goal of this level is for you to hack the basic token contract below.

You are given 20 tokens to start with and you will beat the level if you somehow manage to get your hands on any additional tokens. Preferably a very large amount of tokens.

  Things that might help:

What is an odometer?

So I just have to send 21 tokens some random guy then I will have a lot of tokens.


Token
Level completed!
Difficulty 3/10

Overflows are very common in solidity and must be checked for with control statements such as:

if(a + c > a) {
  a = a + c;
}
An easier alternative is to use OpenZeppelin's SafeMath library that automatically checks for overflows in all the mathematical operators. The resulting code looks like this:

a = a.add(c);
If there is an overflow, the code will revert.
