Vault
Difficulty 3/10

Unlock the vault to pass the level!


220310 03:37 I think there are two ways.

either
1)figure out what was the password (I think I can check etherscan to know what was in the constructor)

2)change
bool locked upstream from an inheriting contract.

03:42 KSt I found the transaction log in etherscan.

https://rinkeby.etherscan.io/tx/0x150bcbb70e971a7ba28c6f2e7cf39e5e141985f1314a77882d39c14fdc32a648

the input data was 

0xdfc86b17000000000000000000000000f94b476063b6379a3c8b6c836efb8b3e10ede188

so i think this is the password.

hm... keeps givign me error

220310 03:48 ah. the hex above is not password. it is input data, so I think it means
it's the data that was input when constructor was called.


How to decode input data from a transaction?
https://ethereum.stackexchange.com/questions/11144/how-to-decode-input-data-from-a-transaction

hex ToAscii
https://web3js.readthedocs.io/en/v1.2.9/web3-utils.html?highlight=toascii#hextoascii

web3.utils.hexToAscii(hex)

I will try this on the console.

I got this
"ÃŸÃˆk\u0017\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000Ã¹KG`cÂ¶7Âš<Â‹lÂƒnÃ»Â‹>\u0010Ã­Ã¡Âˆ"

ASCII to text
ï¿½F

hm.. when I do hex to text
ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½pï¿½ï¿½v;cyï¿½È¶ï¿½6ï¸³ï¿½ï¿½

I got this.


maybe I should try

I came here

https://cleanunicorn.github.io/santoku/#/

input data in the encoded abi
type List
bytes32 _password

then I got

0x000000000000000000000000f94b476063b6379a3c8b6c836efb8b3e10ede188

as value

so I do this in the console.
contract.unlock('0x000000000000000000000000f94b476063b6379a3c8b6c836efb8b3e10ede188');

hm...but when I checked the locked variable, still locked was true..

oh,so  it is the last alphabet that starts from f and so on that was the argument


220310 04:13
ohhh.. shit never mind. I should have put in encoded abi.

04:18 Now I tried this


https://ethtx.info/
and got 
this
https://ethtx.info/rinkeby/0x150bcbb70e971a7ba28c6f2e7cf39e5e141985f1314a77882d39c14fdc32a648/

I think this could be the password


I try this now 04:21 KST
await contract.unlock('0x000000000000000000000000a62db47d3ec641dc9430bc8e36a41a59fb33ee09');
hm....and it is still locked.

shibal

when I usd this above

0xdfc86b17000000000000000000000000f94b476063b6379a3c8b6c836efb8b3e10ede188

decode
and the result is
Attempted to decode with createLevelInstance(address)

Error: hex string must have 0x prefix (arg="value", value="000000000000000000000000f94b476063b6379a3c8b6c836efb8b3e10ede188", version=4.0.49)

I was working with totally wrong input data.

220310 04:39 KST
